# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Railway deployment was failing with the error:
```
"composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-cache" did not complete successfully: exit code: 2
```

**Root Cause**: PHP version compatibility mismatch
- Your `composer.json` requires PHP ^8.2
- Railway's build environment was using PHP 8.1.31
- Dependency `maennchen/zipstream-php` v3.1.2 requires PHP ^8.2
- This created an incompatible dependency resolution

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Nixpacks Configuration (`nixpacks.toml`)
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["php82", "php82Packages.composer", "php82Extensions.pdo", "php82Extensions.gd", "php82Extensions.pgsql", "php82Extensions.mbstring", "php82Extensions.zip", "php82Extensions.zlib", "php82Extensions.dom", "php82Extensions.xml"]
nixLibs = ["php82"]

[variables]
PHP_VERSION = "8.2"
NIXPACKS_INSTALL_CMD = "composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-cache"
```

### 2. Added Dockerfile as Alternative Build Method
- Created a comprehensive Dockerfile using `php:8.2-cli`
- Includes all required PHP extensions
- Proper dependency installation and optimization
- Upload directory creation with correct permissions

### 3. Updated Railway Configuration (`railway.json`)
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckPath": "/health.php",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10,
    "startCommand": "php -S 0.0.0.0:${PORT:-3000} -t ."
  }
}
```

### 4. Added Supporting Files
- **`.php-version`**: Explicitly specifies PHP 8.2
- **`health.php`**: Health check endpoint for Railway monitoring
- **Updated composer dependencies**: Ensured compatibility with PHP 8.2

## Deployment Strategy
The deployment now uses Docker instead of Nixpacks for more reliable builds:
1. Uses official PHP 8.2 CLI image
2. Installs all required system dependencies and PHP extensions
3. Runs composer install with proper optimization
4. Creates necessary upload directories with correct permissions
5. Exposes the application on the specified port

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Railway deployment logs to confirm successful build
2. Test application functionality once deployed
3. Verify health check endpoint is working
4. Test file upload functionality with new directory structure

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, you can:
1. Revert `railway.json` to use "NIXPACKS" builder
2. Use the enhanced `nixpacks.toml` configuration
3. Or temporarily use PHP 8.1 compatible dependencies

The changes have been committed and pushed to trigger a new Railway deployment.
