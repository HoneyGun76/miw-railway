3. **Timing Issues** - Previous issues that have since been resolved
4. **Misunderstood Error Messages** - Users might be interpreting warnings as errors

## 📋 **Recommendations**

### Immediate Actions:
1. **User Validation** - Ask user to:
   - Test file upload with specific files that caused issues
   - Provide browser console errors if any
   - Test from different browsers/devices

2. **Enhanced Monitoring** - Continue monitoring:
   - Error logger for new entries
   - Heroku logs for upload failures
   - Database for orphaned records

### Preventive Measures:
1. **Enhanced Error Reporting** - Add more detailed client-side error reporting
2. **File Size Limits** - Implement and display clear file size limits
3. **Upload Progress Indicators** - Add visual feedback for large file uploads
